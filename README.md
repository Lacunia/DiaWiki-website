# DiaWiki-website
This is my personal project - a website dedicated to diabetes patients.

As my family on my mother's side has the genes for diabetes, I myself am subjected to risks of getting diabetes too. I have witnessed the pain and suffering my grandmother went through during her last days as a diabetes patients, as well as my mother's effort to prevent herself from following the same path. As such, I thought that perhaps building a website that is dedicated to providing information to diabetes patients (or potential patients) and allowing them to connect with one another is a great way to contribute in this community with my own effort.
