# DiaWiki-website
This is my personal project - a website dedicated to diabetes patients.

The version made with Wix: https://lucylin6699.wixsite.com/diawiki

As my family on my mother's side has the genes for diabetes, I myself am subjected to risks of getting diabetes too. I have witnessed the pain and suffering my grandmother went through during her last days as a diabetes patients, as well as my mother's effort to prevent herself from following the same path. As such, I thought that perhaps building a website that is dedicated to providing information to diabetes patients (or potential patients) and allowing them to connect with one another is a great way to contribute in this community with my own effort. 

Previously, I used the website builder to create it while designing the UI and collecting the content by myself. Currently I'm working on using Python Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recreate this website. I want to be able to recreate it now that I have certain capabilities of doing so by myself!
