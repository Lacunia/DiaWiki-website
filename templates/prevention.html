                <li>Losing weight can be an effective way of preventing diabetes. By losing approximately 7% to 10% of your body weight once you are diagnosed with prediabetes, which means that you have a high risk of contracting diabetes, is said to be able to reduce your risk by almost 60%.</li>
                <li>However, be cautious not to lose too much weight, lest it affect your health negatively. Your goal is to first meet your weight loss goal of around 7 to 10%, and then maintain a healthy weight moving forward.</li>
